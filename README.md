# philosophers

This project is a training to multi-threads programming with the use of mutex.
It contains program simulating a twist of the famous Dining Philosophers problem.
This project is also a good lesson in C optimization as we need to save every bit of CPU usage we can to ensure the survival of our philosophers.

## ðŸ’» DONE

â€¢ The philosophers must never be starving. 
â€¢ Every philosopher needs to eat. 
â€¢ Philosophers donâ€™t speak with each other. 
â€¢ Philosophers donâ€™t know when another philosopher is about to die. 
â€¢ Each time a philosopher has finished eating, he will drop his forks and start sleeping. 
â€¢ When a philosopher is done sleeping, he will start thinking. 
â€¢ The simulation stops when a philosopher dies. 
â€¢ One fork between each philosopher, therefore if they are multiple philosophers, there will be a fork at the right and the left of each philosopher. 
â€¢ Each philosopher should be a thread.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/mlagranzh/philosophers
  ```
 
## ðŸš€ Run
  ```shell
  make; ./philo number_of_philo time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep
  ```
  
- number_of_philo: is the number of philosophers and also the number of forks.
- time_to_die: is time each philosopher must ate
- time_to_eat: is the time it takes for a philosopher to eat.
- time_to_sleep: is the time the philosopher will spend sleeping.

or run:
  ```shell
  make; ./philo number_of_philo time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep number_of_times
  ```
where  number_of_times is the number each philosopher should eat and then simulation stops.
